1) 

<li><a><i class="fa fa-edit"></i> Projects Summary <span class="fa fa-chevron-down"></span></a>
<ul class="nav child_menu">
<li><a href="temp-summary.php">Show All</a></li>

Add above lines to the left pane menu of every webpage to show the link to “All Projects” Page which is temp-summary.php

2) Please replace your css file custom.css in build/css folder with the one in the folder I have shared. 
    It has CSS for table. It won’t affect other code, as all the other pages use custom.min css file.

3) If you don’t want that, rename my custom.css file to say, newcustom.css and make following 
    change at Line 20 of temp-summary.php
	<!-- Custom Theme Style -->	
		<link href="build/css/newcustom.css" rel="stylesheet">
